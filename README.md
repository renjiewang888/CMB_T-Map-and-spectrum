These workbooks are based on a notebook for the CMB Analysis SummerSchool(https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool).
We plot the CMB temperature spectrum from a CAMB simulation.Then we generate a simulated map of the CMB sky with the spectrum. Finally, we compute the CMB power spectrum from the simulated map and compare it to the input power spectrum for our simulations.
